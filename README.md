# Football Player Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting comprehensive data analysis on football player statistics sourced from TransferMarkt and FBRef. The primary objective is to provide recommendations for potential player acquisitions based on their performance metrics and market valuation. The project encompasses various stages including data scraping, cleaning, merging, analysis, and prediction using machine learning techniques.

## Process
1. **Data Scraping**: Scraping data from multiple websites including TransferMarkt and FBRef to gather comprehensive player statistics and market information.
2. **Data Cleaning and Merging**: Cleaning the scraped data to ensure consistency and accuracy, followed by merging relevant tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing in-depth analysis on player statistics to identify key performance indicators and trends that can influence player valuation and potential.
4. **Recommendation System**: Utilizing cosine similarity to recommend similar players based on selected criteria, aiding decision-making in player acquisitions.
5. **Market Value Prediction**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict the market value of players based on their performance metrics and market trends.
